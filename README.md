#QAnswer -- simple quiz.

Nothing fancy here, just a basic Q&A program. This program was implemented using hash tables to store the questions and the answers. When you start the program you will be presented with certain amount of multiple choice questions to answer and finish the game. if you miss 3 questions, you are out. I'm the only member on this project.

##How to run
To run the program, simply compile it using a GNU compiler and it should work but the program requires c++11 based compiler. I worked on codeblocks IDE but it should compile independent of the IDE.

##Dependencies
None

##System requirements
I don't think there are any system requirements except for the compiler.
